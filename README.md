Problem Statement:

X Education, an online education company, faces challenges with its lead conversion process despite generating numerous leads daily. With a typical lead conversion rate of only 30%, they aim to boost efficiency by identifying the most promising leads, termed 'Hot Leads', to focus their sales efforts effectively.

Their lead conversion process resembles a funnel, where many leads enter but only a few become paying customers. Effective nurturing of potential leads in the middle stage is crucial for higher conversion rates.

To address this issue, X Education seeks assistance in developing a lead scoring model. This model should assign a lead score to each lead, indicating their likelihood of converting into paying customers. The objective is to prioritize leads with higher scores for focused sales efforts, aiming to achieve a target lead conversion rate of 80%.

In summary, X Education desires a model that can accurately predict lead conversion probabilities, facilitating targeted sales strategies and improving overall conversion rates.

To build a lead scoring model for X Education, one can follow these steps:
Data Loading
Data Exploration (EDA)
Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Outlier Analysis
Splitting Data into Train and Test Set
Model Building
Model Performance Benchmarking
Model Performance Evaluation
Cross Validation + Hyperparameter Tuning
Model Diagnosis Using Probability Calibration, ROC AUC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
Making Predictions
Prediction on Test Set
Precision-Recall
By following these steps, X Education can develop a robust lead scoring system that helps prioritize leads with the highest conversion potential, ultimately improving the efficiency of their sales process.
